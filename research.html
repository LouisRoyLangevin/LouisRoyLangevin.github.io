                <h3>Attachement Trees (2024) <href a="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18614">Article</href></h3>
                <p class="research-text">This is a full-time research project financed by the ISM grant (I received an offer for the NSERC grant, but I had to decline it for administrative reasons) and supervised by Prof. Louigi Addario-Berry from McGill University.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The main goal of this research is to study the efficiency of algorithms that find the root of uniform attachment trees with high probability.
                    <br/><br/>
                    A uniform attachment tree is a tree (acyclic graph) that was constructed as follows :<br/>
                    0) Choose any natural number \(n\).<br/>
                    1) Start with a single vertex \(v_0\)called the root.<br/>
                    2) Attach a new vertex \(v_1\) to \(v_0\) with an edge.<br/>
                    3) Randomly choose a vertex in {\(v_1\), \(v_0\)} uniformly and attach a new vertex \(v_2\) to it with an edge.<br/>
                    4) Randomly choose a vertex in {\(v_2\), \(v_1\), \(v_0\)} uniformly and attach a new vertex \(v_2\) to it with an edge.<br/>
                    5) Repeat this process until there are \(n\) vertices in your tree. The graph you obtain is the uniform attachment tree.
                    <br/><br/>
                    A root finding algorithm is an algorithm that takes a uniform attachment tree \(T = ( V , E )\) and a positive real number \(\varepsilon > 0\) as an input.  It then outputs a subset \(W\) of \(V\) of size independent of \(T\) such that the probability that the root of \(T\) is in \(W\) is at least \(1 - \varepsilon\).
                    <br/><br/>
                    Note here that it may seem surprising that the size of \(W\) does not depend on \(T\). You are not alone if you felt that way, it is a very nice result!
                    <br/><br/>
                    For such an algorithm to be considered efficient, we want the size of \(W\) to be as small as possible as a function of \(\varepsilon > 0\).  The way we characterize the efficiency of algorithms is by comparing the asymptotic behaviours of the size of \(W\) as \(\varepsilon \to 0\) for different algorithms.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The main topic I worked on during this project is trying to upper bound and lower bound the optimal asymptotic behaviour that any root finding algorithm can reach.

                <h3>The Burning Number (2023)</h3>
                <p class="research-text">This is a full-time research project financed by the NSERC grant and supervised by Prof. Sergey Norin from McGill University.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The main goal of this research is to improve the advancements that have been made regarding the Burning Number conjecture.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Given any finite connected graph \(G = ( V , E )\), we can define a metric space \(( V , d )\) where \(d(u,v)\) is equal to the length of the shortest path between \(u\) and \(v\).
                    <br/><br/>
                    For a vertex \(v\) and a natural number \(r\), a ball of radius \(r\) around \(v\) is defined as \(B_r(v) = \{u \in V : d(u,v) \le r\}\), i.e. all the vertices that are at distance from \(v\) less than or equal to \(r\).
                    <br/><br/>
                    The burning number of a graph \(G = ( V , E )\), denoted \(B(G)\), is the minimal natural number \(k\) such that there exist \(v_0,v_1,\ldots,v_{k-1} \in V\) with \(V = \bigcup_{i=0}^{k-1} B_i(v_i)\).<br/>
                    Clearly such a number \(k\) must exist since we can enumerate \(V\) as \(V = \{v_0,\ldots,v_{|V|-1}\}\) to get that \(V = \bigcup_{i=0}^{|V|-1} B_i(v_i)\)</i>.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The Burning Number conjecture states that for any graph \(G = ( V , E )\), \(B(G) \le \sqrt{|V|}\).
                    <br/><br/>
                    This conjecture has not been proven nor disproven yet.  Our goal during this research was to contribute to the advancement of the knowledge that we have regarding this conjecture.
