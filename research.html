                <h3>Attachement Trees (2024) <href a="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18614">Article</href></h3>
                <p class="research-text">This is a full-time research project financed by the ISM grant (I received an offer for the NSERC grant, but I had to decline it for administrative reasons) and supervised by Prof. Louigi Addario-Berry from McGill University.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The main goal of this research is to study the efficiency of algorithms that find the root of uniform attachment trees with high probability.
                    <br/><br/>
                    A uniform attachment tree is a tree (acyclic graph) that was constructed as follows :<br/>
                    0) Choose any natural number \(n\).<br/>
                    1) Start with a single vertex \(v_0\)called the root.<br/>
                    2) Attach a new vertex \(v_1\) to \(v_0\) with an edge.<br/>
                    3) Randomly choose a vertex in {\(v_1\), \(v_0\)} uniformly and attach a new vertex v<sub>2</sub> to it with an edge.<br/>
                    4) Randomly choose a vertex in {\(v_2\), \(v_1\), \(v_0\)} uniformly and attach a new vertex \(v_2\) to it with an edge.<br/>
                    5) Repeat this process until there are \(n\) vertices in your tree. The graph you obtain is the uniform attachment tree.
                    <br/><br/>
                    A root finding algorithm is an algorithm that takes a uniform attachment tree \(T = ( V , E )\) and a positive real number \(\varepsilon > 0\) as an input.  It then outputs a subset \(W\) of \(V\) of size independent of \(T\) such that the probability that the root of \(T\) is in \(W\) is at least \(1 - \varepsilon\).
                    <br/><br/>
                    Note here that it may seem surprising that the size of <i>W</i> does not depend on <i>T</i>. You are not alone if you felt that way, it is a very nice result!
                    <br/><br/>
                    For such an algorithm to be considered efficient, we want the size of <i>W</i> to be as small as possible as a function of <i>&epsilon;</i>.  The way we characterize the efficiency of algorithms is by comparing the asymptotic behaviours of the size of <i>W</i> as <i>&epsilon;</i> approaches 0 for different algorithms.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The main topic I worked on during this project is trying to upper bound and lower bound the optimal asymptotic behaviour that any root finding algorithm can reach.

                <h3>The Burning Number (2023)</h3>
                <p class="research-text">This is a full-time research project financed by the NSERC grant and supervised by Prof. Sergey Norin from McGill University.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The main goal of this research is to improve the advancements that have been made regarding the Burning Number conjecture.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Given any finite connected graph <i>G = ( V , E )</i>, we can define a metric space <i>( V , d )</i> where <i>d(u,v)</i> is equal to the length of the shortest path between <i>u</i> and <i>v</i>.
                    <br/><br/>
                    For a vertex <i>v</i> and a natural number <i>r</i>, a ball of radius <i>r</i> around <i>v</i> is defined as <i>B<sub>r</sub>(v) = {u &#8712; V : d(u,v) &#8804; r}</i>, i.e. all the vertices that are at distance from <i>v</i> less than or equal to <i>r</i>.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The burning number of a graph <i>G = ( V , E )</i>, denoted <i>B(G)</i>, is the minimal natural number <i>k</i> such that there exist <i>v<sub>0</sub>,v<sub>1</sub>,...,v<sub>k-1</sub>&#8712V</i> with <i>V=B<sub>0</sub>(v<sub>0</sub>)&#8899;B<sub>1</sub>(v<sub>1</sub>)&#8899;...&#8899;B<sub>k-1</sub>(v<sub>k-1</sub>)</i>.<br/>
                    Clearly such a number <i>k</i> must exist since we can enumerate <i>V</i> as <i>V={v<sub>0</sub>,...,v<sub>|V|-1</sub>}</i> to get that <i>V=B<sub>0</sub>(v<sub>0</sub>)&#8899;...&#8899;B<sub>|V|-1</sub>(v<sub>|V|-1</sub>)</i>.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The Burning Number conjecture states that for any graph <i>G = ( V , E )</i>, <i>B(G) &#8804; &#8730;|V|</i>.
                    <br/><br/>
                    This conjecture has not been proven nor disproven yet.  Our goal during this research was to contribute to the advancement of the knowledge that we have regarding this conjecture.
